# 👁️👁️ Lumi  
**Your Friendly Eye Care Companion**

## 💡 About the App  
In today's screen-dominated world, prolonged device usage often leads to **eye fatigue**. To tackle this, our team, *Twilight*, presents **Lumi** – an app that encourages users to take regular screen breaks by following the **20-20-20 rule**.

Lumi gently reminds users every 20 minutes to rest their eyes for 20 seconds while looking at something 20 feet away. The app offers **step-by-step guidance** and a **built-in 20-second timer** to help users stay consistent.

To make the experience enjoyable, Lumi integrates **gamification**:  
- 🎯 Earn coins for every successful break  
- 🐸 Use coins to unlock **new frogs** and explore **new areas** in your personal **virtual pond**  
- 🌱 Your progress in taking care of your eyes is visualized through this relaxing environment
